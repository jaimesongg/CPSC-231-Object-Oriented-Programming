## Project Summary

This project simulates a tournament where characters from different classes—Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, and Commoner—compete based on their strength. The goal is to determine the strongest character through a series of comparisons. 

### Program Structure

- **Character (Abstract Class):** Base class for all character types with common attributes like name and level.
- **Commoner, Fighter, Rogue, Wizard:** Subclasses representing different character types, each with unique attributes (e.g., grit, stealth, known spells).
- **Tournament:** Manages the tournament, stores competitors, and determines the winner.
- **Runner:** Contains the main method to interact with the user, input character details, and run the tournament.

### Features

- The system uses **file I/O** to read character data and employs an **ArrayList** to manage competitors.
- The design is **modular** and **extendable**, with future plans to:
  - Add more character types with unique attributes.
  - Develop a **graphical interface** for a more interactive experience.
  - Integrate an **API** to get character data from an online database for more variety.
